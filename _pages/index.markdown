I am an Assistant Professor in the Social Science Division at New York University Abu Dhabi. I am an applied microeconomist, with research interests straddling Economic History, Political Economy, and Behavioral Economics. 

My work in economic history is focused on the development of the British state. Several of my papers use the British experience to test theories in political economy, such as the effects of democratization on government spending. Another strand of research investigates the role of the state in Britain's mortality decline.

My research in behavioral economics focuses on eliciting behavioral preferences in broad populations, as part of the [World Econographics Project](http://www.its.caltech.edu/~snowberg/wep.html). In a series of papers we use data from incentivized, representative, surveys to investigate the relationships between different behavioral preferences, and between economic preferences and socio-demographic characteristics.
