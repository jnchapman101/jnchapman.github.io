##### Abstract

It is well-recognized that both improved nutrition and sanitation
infrastructure are important contributors to mortality decline.
However the relative importance of the two factors is difficult to
quantify, since most studies are limited to testing the effects of
specific sanitary improvements. This paper uses new historical data
regarding total investment in urban infrastructure, measured using
the outstanding loan stock, to estimate the extent to which the
mortality decline in England and Wales between 1861 and 1900 can be
attributed to government investment. Fixed effects regressions indicate
that infrastructure investment explains approximately 22-25% of the
decline in mortality between 1861 and 1900, once time trends are
accounted for. Since these specifications may not fully account for
the endogoneity between investment and mortality, I perform additional
specifications using lagged investment as an instrument for current
investment. These estimates suggest that government investment was
the major contributor to mortality decline, explaining up to 60% of
the reduction in total urban mortality between 1861 and 1900 and 88%
between 1861 and 1890. Additional results indicate that investment
in urban infrastructure led to declines in mortality from both
waterborne and airborne diseases.
