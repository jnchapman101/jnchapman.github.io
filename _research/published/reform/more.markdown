##### Abstract

Several theories have argued that democratic reform will lead to higher
government spending. However, these theories have generally focused on
expenditure on redistribution rather than expenditure on public goods.
This paper presents a model predicting that democratization leads to
lower government expenditure on infrastructure if the median pre-reform
voter is middle class. This prediction is tested using a new panel
dataset of town council infrastructure spending and revenue in
nineteenth-century Britain. An 1894 national reform implementing
a system of "one-household-one-vote" and the secret ballot is used
as the treatment event in a difference-in-difference analysis. The
results show that democratic reform slowed the growth of town council
investment in public goods, including water supply and other public
infrastructure. In line with the theoretical prediction, this negative
effect was strongest when democratic reform transferred power from
the middle class to the poor.
