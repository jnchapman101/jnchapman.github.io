Idea: Some individuals pay to publically signal reciprocity, even at the cost of the person they are reciprocating to.

##### Abstract

Many individuals act more selfishly in games when actions are hidden
and their image is not at risk. However, some individuals may still
desire to publicly signal reciprocity or other socially desired
behavior in these contexts. These individuals may view hidden actions
not as an opportunity to act selfishly, but rather as an obstacle to
signaling preferences or type. Study 1 tests this by implementing a
trust game where nature stochastically intervenes and allocates
nothing in place of the second-moverâ€™s choice. When nature intervenes,
many second-movers choose to sacrifice pay in order to truthfully
signal that they attempted to allocate more, and that they therefore
tried to reciprocate. Since signaling can be costly, Study 2 tests
whether some individuals strategically reject interactions that could
necessitate this type of signaling response. Players play two rounds
of dictator games of increasing size, swapping roles in between. In
treatments that allow it, many players reject allocations from their
partner in the first round; they then act more selfishly as the
dictator in the subsequent, higher-stakes round. Together, these
results emphasize that the need to signal reciprocity or other
socially desired behavior can influence how people engage with and
respond to others in strategic contexts.
