##### Abstract

This paper investigates how extending the franchise affected government spending in British towns between 1867 and 1900. The effect of franchise extension is identified by exploiting extensive regional and temporal variation in the right to vote. The results show robust evidence of an inverted U-shaped relationship: extending the right to vote from the rich to the middle class led to increased spending, but further franchise extensions---beyond around 50% of the adult male population---led to lower expenditure. Further, government spending was lower in towns where the poor were enfranchised by national reforms, in contrast to the predictions of many theoretical models of democratization. Analysis of local newspaper reports also demonstrates that working class citizens resisted higher expenditure. A simple model, supported by historical evidence, explains these results by emphasizing the trade-offs between public spending and private consumption faced by poor voters. Many theories of democratization suggest that extending the right to
vote will lead to increased government expenditure (e.g. Meltzer and Richard, 1981; Lizzeri and Persico, 2004; Acemoglu and Robinson, 2000), these results suggest that may only be true when government has the ability to engage in widespread redistribution.
