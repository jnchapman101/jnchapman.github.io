##### Abstract

An enormous literature documents that willingness to pay (WTP) is
less than willingness to accept (WTA) a monetary amount for an
object, a phenomenon called the endowment effect. Using data from
an incentivized survey of a representative sample of 3,000 U.S.
adults, we add one (probably) surprising additional finding: WTA
and WTP for a lottery are, at best, slightly correlated. Across
all respondents, the correlation is slightly negative. A meta-study
of published experiments with university students shows a correlation
of around 0.15-0.2, consistent with the correlation in our data for
high-IQ respondents. While poorly related to each other, WTA and WTP
are closely related to different measures of risk aversion, and
relatively stable across time. We show that the endowment effect
is not related to individual-level measures of loss aversion,
counter to Prospect Theory or Stochastic Reference Dependence.
