##### Abstract

We introduce DOSEâ€”Dynamically Optimized Sequential Experimentation &mdash;
and use it to estimate individual-level loss aversion in a representative
sample of the U.S. population (N=2,000). DOSE elicitations are more
accurate, more stable across time, and faster to administer than standard
methods. We find that around 50% of the U.S. population is loss tolerant.
This is counter to earlier findings, which mostly come from lab/student
samples, that a strong majority of participants are loss averse. Loss
attitudes are correlated with cognitive ability: loss aversion is more
prevalent in people with high cognitive ability, and loss tolerance is
more common in those with low cognitive ability. We also use DOSE to
document facts about risk and time preferences, indicating a high
potential for DOSE in future research.
