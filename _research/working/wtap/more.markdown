##### Abstract

We study the endowment effect—the divergence between Willingness to Accept (WTA) and Willingness to Pay (WTP)—using three incentivized, representative surveys of 4,000 U.S. adults. We find that the endowment effect is uncorrelated with loss aversion for risky prospects, contrary to the prediction of leading theories, such as Prospect Theory. We then document three additional novel findings about the relationship between WTA and WTP, and use them to narrow the space of plausible theories of the endowment effect. First, WTA and WTP are, at best, weakly correlated. Second, around 30% of participants exhibit a negative endowment effect—WTP>WTA. Third, WTA and WTP for lotteries strongly relate to other aspects of risk preferences. Out of theories that cover both the endowment effect and risk preferences, only
Cautious Utility is consistent with all of these findings.
