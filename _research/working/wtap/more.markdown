##### Abstract

A vast literature documents that willingness to pay (WTP) is less than willingness to
accept (WTA) a monetary amount for an object, a phenomenon called the endowment
effect. Using data from three incentivized studies with a total representative sample
of 4,000 U.S. adults, we add one additional finding: WTA and WTP for a lottery
are (essentially) uncorrelated. In contrast, independent measures of WTA (or WTP)
are highly correlated, and relatively stable across time. Leading models of reference-dependent
preferences are compatible with a zero correlation between WTA and WTP,
but only for specific parameterizations and ruling out popular special cases. These
models also predict a relationship between the endowment effect and loss aversion,
which we do not find.
