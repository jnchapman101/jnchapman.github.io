##### Abstract

Many theories of democratization suggest that extending the right to
vote will lead to increased government expenditure (e.g. Meltzer and
Richard, 1981; Lizzeri and Persico, 2004; Acemoglu and Robinson, 2000).
However, these models frequently assume that government can engage in
transfer expenditure, which is often not true for local governments.
This paper presents a model in which government expenditure is limited
to the provision of public goods. The model predicts that the poor and
the rich desire lower public goods expenditure than the middle class:
the rich because of the relatively high tax burden, and the poor
because of a high marginal utility of consumption. Consequently
extensions of the franchise to the poor can be associated with
declines in government expenditure on public goods. This prediction
is tested using a new dataset of local government financial accounts
in England between 1867 and 1900, which captures government expenditure
on key infrastructure projects that are not included in many studies
of national democratic reform. The empirical analysis, by exploiting
plausibly exogenous variation in the extent of the franchise, shows
strong support for the theoretical prediction: expenditure increased
following relatively small extensions of the franchise, but fell
following extensions of the franchise beyond around 50% of the adult
male population.
