##### Abstract

This paper tests the relationship between inequality, democratization,
and expenditure on poor relief in England and Wales between 1885 and 1905.
Poor relief served as the main form of social insurance at that
time and, in contrast to modern-day welfare programs, was provided by
elected local governments. As a result, policy varied substantially
across the country in terms of both the magnitude and nature of the
support provided. Prior to 1894, a number of institutional features
&mdash;a graduated franchise, the absence of a secret ballot, and
the participation of unelected magistrates&mdash;helped landowners
to control these local councils, and hence poor law policy. These
advantages were removed by a national reform in 1894, an event which
serves as the treatment event in a difference-in-difference analysis.
The analysis tests whether the effect of this reform varied according
to the level of inequality in each district, as predicted by theoretical
models of democratization. The results show that, consistent with these
theories, unequal districts experienced greater increases in poor law
expenditure following democratic reform.
