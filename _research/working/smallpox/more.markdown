##### Abstract

This study investigates why smallpox remained endemic in Britain into the twentieth century, despite the discovery of an effective vaccine in 1796 and high vaccination rates from the 1850s onward. Using newly digitized data on local mortality and vaccination outcomes, it shows that the effectiveness and safety of vaccination improved only gradually—and only after repeated state intervention. Poor implementation often rendered vaccination ineffective until the 1870s, and it remained relatively unsafe until the early twentieth century. A triple-difference analysis shows that the introduction of government quality standards—supported by inspections and performance-based incentives—was critical to making vaccination effective. The paper underscores that state capacity, rather than medical technology alone, determined the success of early 
public health interventions.
