We show that state legal and collective capacity contributed to economic development during the Industrial Revolution. In England and Wales, the Monarchy and Parliament relied on local magistrates, known as Justices of the Peace (JPs), to enforce property rights, resolve disputes, and administer local public services. We assemble a unique dataset to document the expanding role of JPs in the economy during the eighteenth century. We find that counties with greater legal capacity---proxied by the number of JPs---in 1700 experienced greater population growth and more structural change over the following 140 years. Plausibly exogenous variation in the allocation of JPs to areas, driven by historical political factors, suggests a causal interpretation of the findings. Additional results show that more legal capacity led to more human capital, fiscal capacity, and infrastructure development. Together, the results suggest that the JPs were an important and underappreciated ``street-level'' institution that played an role in Britain's industrialization.
