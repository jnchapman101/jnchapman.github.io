#### Financing Sanitation Infrastructure in Nineteenth-Century England and Wales.

Under Review

[Working Paper]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/pdf/sanitation.pdf %})

##### Abstract

This paper investigates the role of high borrowing costs in deterring
sanitation investment in late nineteenth-century Britain. Many councils
were not providing public goods such as water supply and sewer systems
even at the end of the century, despite having had access to government
loans since the 1860s. Using an annual dataset of the financial accounts
of almost seven hundred town councils, the paper identifies significant
variation in the interest rates that towns had to pay when borrowing to
fund investment. Panel regressions show that higher interest rates were
associated with significantly lower levels of sanitation investment, with
the relationship robust to controlling for town tax base, non-tax revenue
sources, demographic characteristics, and town fixed effects. The regression
estimates imply that providing loans at the government’s cost of borrowing
would have increased the stock of sanitation infrastructure in 1903 by
around 25%, and so potentially hastened Britain’s mortality decline.
