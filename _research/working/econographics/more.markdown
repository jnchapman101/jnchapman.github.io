##### Abstract

We study the pattern of correlations across a large number of
behavioral regularities, with the goal of creating an empirical
basis for more comprehensive theories of decision-making. We
elicit 21 behaviors using an incentivized survey on a
representative sample (n=1,000) of the U.S. population. Our
data show a clear and relatively simple structure underlying
the correlations between these measures. Using principal
components analysis, we reduce the 21 variables to six
components corresponding to clear clusters of high correlations.
We examine the relationship between these components, cognitive
ability, and demographics, and discuss the theoretical
implications of the structure we uncover.
