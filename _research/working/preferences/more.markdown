##### Abstract

This chapter reviews methods for eliciting risk, time, and social preferences. We first recap the major conceptual issues in preference elicitation, including how preferences are defined and formed, and the importance and potential concerns of eliciting them. Next, we present a ``toolkit'' used to elicit preferences, discussing the advantages and drawbacks of prominent elicitation methods and providing an overview of important econometric techniques. The discussion covers both classic elicitation methods that have formed the foundation for insights into preferences, including binary choices and matching techniques, and more recent methods, such as multiple price lists and convex time budgets. We then consider two newer tools that offer promise for future research---dynamic optimal adaptive methods, such as DOSE, and experimentally-validated preference modules. We provide a step-by-step guide to best practices when choosing an elicitation method and implementing preference elicitations in different research settings. This guide discusses practical concerns a researcher may face, including how best to deal with measurement error, whether incentivized measures are needed, the potential for framing effects, and other issues. The chapter concludes by pointing to future directions for methodological research and possible applications for preference measures.
